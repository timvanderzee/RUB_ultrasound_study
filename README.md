# Welcome to the 'RUB_ultrasound_study' repository!

This repository includes MATLAB code to reproduce the results figures of our [recent preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.07.607010v1). 

To do this, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Clone or download the [violinplot repository from Bastian Bechtold](https://github.com/bastibe/Violinplot-Matlab). In MATLAB, make sure that this folder is included in your path. 
3. Download the dynamometry.zip and fascicle_tracking_estimates.zip files from [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26502868)
4. Unzip the files and move them to a common folder
5. Run main.m
